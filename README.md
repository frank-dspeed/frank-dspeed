<p>A lot of Projects as i join them together into a uniq Project to reduce the redundancies in them as also allow to focus on new features and better performance
together inside the projects. I see redundancy as one of the biggest issues today. As We Produce to much stuff without thinking for example there are over 1000 Package Managers around and maybe even more and they all do the same thing more or less...</p>
