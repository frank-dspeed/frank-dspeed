### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am âœ¨ Frank Lemanschik âœ¨ a German Distributed Cross Arch Platform OS Engineer.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
a ECMAScript Driven ECOSYSTEM to run Code in a Secure Scaleable Fashion on Any Device and reduce the existing redundancies in the Ecosystems dependencies like Chromium, ChromiumOS, NodeJS, V8, FuchsaOS, Linux. see: https://github.com/stealify

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
Building Universal Capability based Systems to create faster Software my learning Source is real Production code that is to hard to maintain update and work with overall.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
Eveything in that short High Level view: Rust, C, C++, LLVM, Linux, Android, FuchsiaOS, Chromium, GraalVM and all Stuff Envolved in Building them and software with them. https://github.com/stealify-backports 

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
With the https://github.com/stealify Overall Project i need to create a Community of Passionated Engineers most best Professionals that already understand the core problem and help me to Apply the needed Proven Solutions to them. Like Making Libs work with Capability Based Invocation Procedure Call Protocol. see: CapNproto.

# ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- VM Engineering
- Engineering Fundamentals ALU Design, CPU Design, GPU and so on BUS Systems processing methods 
- Operating System Design and Security as also Performance Tuning any Os, May it be Your Own Written Kernel or Linux, MacOS, FuchsiaOs, Android, IOS, I am your Man i invested over 10 Years into reading the docs and Fundamentals.
- JVM Implementation
- V8 Implementation
- VMM Design and Implementation 
- ECMAScript Engine Design and Embedding TC39 Specs
- Browser Implementation and Design as also Interop and everything you can know about that beasts of Software that need to be highly Secure as They execute untrusted Source Code.
- Confined Environments and Hardining as also Management and Operation of Large Deployments.
- Declarativ Builds and Build Systems overall
- Coding Language Implementation and Design.

# ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Use any Social Media Even github my Full Name is Frank Lemanschik is you maybe Know already see: ðŸ˜„

# ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: 
Fraenk or simply call me SP33D or Bomberman Two Nicks from my Early days as i learn2crack and reverse engineered 

# âš¡ Fun fact: ... 
- Windows is Possible without Spyware https://ameliorated.info/documentation.html
- There is over 100x Code redundancy in near every bigger project dependencie management is a own job today
- Technical debt often gets Ignored Until It is to late

### What i am doing in Short
I Help Organisations to Produce Web Driven Applications with and without a GUI also Embedded Devices I did invest a lot of time diging into messaging and context boundary issues the fundamentals of distributed systems and load optimization. This made me a Uniq Source of Knowleg about Fast Rendering of big WebApplications and Fast Execution of Large Distributed Tasks parallel and in sync. I Gained also a Lot of Language Implementer and VM Engineering Knowleg while doing the before sayed. I am a Security aware Person that spots 0Day issues on a daily basis but also i was never able to fix them fast enough i am a single Person thats why i invent all this to address my own need to Build Software as a Single Person whit the Quality and Standards of Big Companys to solve the needs of them fast and with the needed Quality and Security Considerations.

At Present i mainly apply this HPC Fundamentals on OS Core Level while creating a Git Management System (Workflow) as Also A Coding Language that reuses existing Languages. And a Build Tool that can Guess Possible Builds by Understanding your Code.

My Dream is it to create a Easy way to Create Software that Follows Today Standards while droping all the history related bloat that we produced before as we got in the early days not the Processor Power to Build Software that Manages it self we got more Processor Power then we Need today but we waist humand Power. This needs to end.

## Current Talks
- Master Class V8, JVM Engineering as also VMM Concepts on a Low Level. Kernel Designs and Interfaces.
- How to create Desktop Apps with Oracle GraalVM, NodeJS, Deno and Chromium as a Platform and or Any WebView Implementation eg: JavaFX, jcef, javacef
  - You will learn how to Create a Web Application that is using python via GraalVM directly exposed inside the Browsers Context as Function.
  - You will learn how to Control diffrent Browsers via the low level devtools Protocol and other InterOp Topics
  - Every Talk should have something Amazing so you will learn how to Binary Pipe Data between Multiple Contexts GraalVM, NodeJS, Browsers
    The Amazing part of a Binary Pipe is that you can pipe raw binary data out of every native code application into a other. Enables for example
      - Direct Rendering from Blender (Software to Produce 3d Movies the Cinema Once) onto WebGPU (a raw GPU Api replacing WebGL in browsers.)
- How to create and Maintain Web Driven Apps Repository Organisation Package Managers Transpillers handle all the Ecosystem Edge cases fast to get faster results choose Depenencies Code Auditing License Managment.
- CI Testing and Releasing Optimization aka Reducing time to build and test. 
- Language Implementation on GraalVM
- Language Implementation in ECMAScript via tagged template strings aka how Stealify Lang Is Implemented.

As you can see my main love is to Create and Run Apps Faster and more Secure and Scaleable on any device and any amount of devices.
I got no killer product ready at present but i know a lot about Problems in the current App Development Processes that exist and
try to find solutions for them that will fit together once in a time into a Product Maybe Called Stealify Lang and that will be used to write a Platform that is install able on Legacy OS'es like ChromiumOS FuchsiaOS WindowsOS Linux and Mac supporting the most majority of CPU's and GPU's as also Interface Boards so it is a Great fit to deploy and code apps for that target Environment. OpenPwa should be able to run Stealify Modules and enforce rules on them.

## Why Stealify Lang
I saw the need for a Polyglot Language Framework and i saw a good Implementation for that as i saw GraalVM i was thinking about that already as i saw that typescript got accepted by users i was not sure about that. Flow was supirior with its type annotation inlined but the vscode integration of typescript was maybe what made it a success. And it showed to me that this is a great way to Improve coders as Rust got created with the same idea in mind directly designed into the language. 

My head was always thinking about the best coding lang now i know it did not exist as each lang has its pros and cons the only solution is a Universal Language that Works and offers fast feedback. But that is not enough the language needs a total new form of Compiler Target VM's including the tooling to profile and optimize this VM's on build and while running. So We need a Compiler Feedback Interface again a Universal one that is able to gather Compiler metrics and other feedback.

i also saw the need to support any language so i do not re invent the wheel i only want to apply the same patterns and a universal language over all existing code so that i need to learn less and can produce more so Stealify was Born the first scope was Simply to create a Collection of Tools then i found out that this does not scale so the first step was to create integrations into existing tools. Here a list of Main Integration points for the Meta Language. As you can see this goes Low Level we call that a so Called Language Framework the following components do form a stealify-ecmascript language framework.

- [ ] stealify-typescript 
- [ ] stealify-eslint 
- [ ] stealify-pnp-npm 
- [ ] stealify-rollup 
- [ ] stealify-graaljs
- [ ] stealify-es4x
- [ ] .....

## Why Open Pwa? 
I know PWA is a Google thing and google is evil but it explains well what i try to archive i want to generate progressiv enhancing apps based on 
web tech and networking at large scale (KI, BigData). 

## Open PWA is already Dead=? Yes! Web Driven Application is Born WDA
Yes it is it will get a proposal for a Universal Permission and Install System for the WebInterop Platforms (wintercg)
It also trys to algin Api's like NodeJS VM Module and WebWorkers as also importScripts to have a single way to deploy
Web Driven Applications.

## CapN is Born
Out of All the Engineering on Concepts like Open PWA and later WDA as also diffrent other App Concepts we finaly Found a good Solution to code modular
web driven apps its not a Real FrameWork as Open PWA Was designed it is more low level it is a Capability Based Nativ Protocol we Created Interop
between that and ECMAScript Driven Applications via Multiple Methods and Interfaces. This allows Finally Fast App Composition.

<p>A lot of Projects as i join them together into a uniq Project to reduce the redundancies in them as also allow to focus on new features and better performance
together inside the projects. I see redundancy as one of the biggest issues today. As We Produce to much stuff without thinking for example there are over 1000 Package Managers around and maybe even more and they all do the same thing more or less...</p>
<p> The Only good way forward is Functional Composition and drop the use of ".this" in ECMAScript as also create better tooling.</p>
