### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Platforms to run Code in a Secure Scaleable Fashion on Any Device and reduce the existing redundancies in the Ecosystems where i am Stakeholder. 

I am stakeholder of the Following Projects

| Projects & Topic | Empty| Details
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Chromium & CEF & v8 as also Tooling | 
| Rust Lang & tooling |
| wasm & tooling |
| EcmaScript & Tooling |
| GraalVM Suite and Tooling |
| Open Stack and Tooling |
| Fuchsia and Tooling |
| Ubuntu & Debian |
| theia & Tooling |
| and many more.... |

As you can see my main love is to Create and Run Apps Faster and more Secure and Scaleable on any device and any amount of devices.
I got no killer product ready at present but i know a lot about Problems in the current App Development Processes that exist and
try to find solutions for them that will fit together once in a time into a Product Maybe Called Stealify Lang and that will be used to write a Platform that is install able on Legacy OS'es like ChromiumOS FuchsiaOS WindowsOS Linux and Mac supporting the most majority of CPU's and GPU's as also Interface Boards so it is a Great fit to deploy and code apps for that target Environment. OpenPwa should be able to run Stealify Modules and enforce rules on them.

## Why Stealify Lang
I saw the need for a Polyglot Language Framework and i saw a good Implementation for that as i saw GraalVM i was thinking about that already as i saw that typescript got accepted by users i was not sure about that. Flow was supirior with its type annotation inlined but the vscode integration of typescript was maybe what made it a success. And it showed to me that this is a great way to Improve coders as Rust got created with the same idea in mind directly designed into the language. 

My head was always thinking about the best coding lang now i know it did not exist as each lang has its pros and cons the only solution is a Universal Language that Works and offers fast feedback. But that is not enough the language needs a total new form of Compiler Target VM's including the tooling to profile and optimize this VM's on build and while running. So We need a Compiler Feedback Interface again a Universal one that is able to gather Compiler metrics and other feedback.

i also saw the need to support any language so i do not re invent the wheel i only want to apply the same patterns and a universal language over all existing code so that i need to learn less and can produce more so Stealify was Born the first scope was Simply to create a Collection of Tools then i found out that this does not scale so the first step was to create integrations into existing tools. Here a list of Main Integration points for the Meta Language. As you can see this goes Low Level we call that a so Called Language Framework the following components do form a stealify-ecmascript language framework.

- [ ] stealify-typescript 
- [ ] stealify-eslint 
- [ ] stealify-pnp-npm 
- [ ] stealify-rollup 
- [ ] stealify-graaljs
- [ ] stealify-es4x
- [ ] .....

## Why Open Pwa?
I know PWA is a Google thing and google is evil but it explains well what i try to archive i want to generate progressiv enhancing apps based on 
web tech and networking at large scale (KI, BigData).

<p>A lot of Projects as i join them together into a uniq Project to reduce the redundancies in them as also allow to focus on new features and better performance
together inside the projects. I see redundancy as one of the biggest issues today. As We Produce to much stuff without thinking for example there are over 1000 Package Managers around and maybe even more and they all do the same thing more or less...</p>
<p> The Only good way forward is Functional Composition and drop the use of ".this" in ECMAScript as also create better tooling.</p>
