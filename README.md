### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Platforms to run Code in a Secure Scaleable Fashion on Any Device and reduce the existing redundancies in the Ecosystems where i am steak holder. 


I am steakholder of the Following Projects

| Projects & Topic | Empty| Details
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Chromium & CEF & v8 as also Tooling | 
| Rust Lang & tooling |
| wasm & tooling |
| EcmaScript & Tooling |
| GraalVM Suite and Tooling |
| Open Stack and Tooling |
| Fuchsia and Tooling |
| Ubuntu & Debian |
| theia & Tooling |
| and many more.... |

As you can see my main love is to Create and Run Apps Faster and more Secure and Scaleable on any device and any amount of devices.
I got no killer product ready at present but i know a lot about Problems in the current App Development Processes that exist and
try to find solutions for them that will fit together once in a time into a Product Maybe Called Open-Pwa

## Why Open Pwa?
I know PWA is a Google thing and google is evil but it explains well what i try to archive i want to generate progressiv enhancing apps based on 
web tech and networking at large scale (KI, BigData).

| Projects & Topic | MVP Done in % | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| @stealify/dom | 95% MVP | Forked Cheerio, parse5, htmlparser2, jsdom  created a single code base with backward compat to a limited degree. |
| @stealify/typescript | 35% Experimental | based on @frank-dspeed/typescript-rollup a typescript fork that uses rollup and tsconfig to resolve dependencies
| Streamline | wip | Creating a Complet Process Management System. With Frontend Integration and Editors. Next Level Web Style System |
| Stealify Components | wip | Creating a Highly Reuseable Collection of WebComponents Including Tooling and SDK for any WebFramework Running on any Environment Cordova, GraalVM, v8:issolates, WASM (Rust WebSys), NodeJS, Deno. WebWorkers and so on.
| <a href="https://github.com/direktspeed/docs-we-design-future">direktspeed/we-design-future</a> | 0% | High Level Roadmap | 
| <a href="https://github.com/direktspeed/was-browser">direktspeed/was-browser</a> & was | 45% | defining a Platform like Open Pwa but make it work only with a single extensible WASI and WASM's | 
| Stealify Chromium | 100% | NodeJS & Chromium Latest Running on the Same V8 Instance. with Optional GraalVM and JVM Support.
| <a href="https://github.com/stealify/stealify">Stealify</a> | 34% | Universal Concepts to Create Software Using JS as High Level Language a Software Encapsulation SDK is also included to create custom v8::isolates and other interresting targets as GraalVM | 
| Stealify Compiler | 76% | KI Driven Autonomouse Software Creation based on Polyglot Code Input more easy explained a transpiler for code into more advanced code including deployment. based on <a href="https://github.com/stealify/stealify">Stealify</a> v8::isolates | 
| Stealify Operator | 21% | KI Driven Autonomouse Software Deployment, Operation based on <a href="https://github.com/stealify/stealify">Stealify</a> v8::isolates | 
| <a href="https://github.com/open-pwa">Open PWA | 49% | A Open Standard Platform written in JS offer multiple API's that runs on any Device | 
| Stealify Java | 27% | Getting GraalJS NodeJS Compatible without node-graal using <a href="https://github.com/stealify/stealify">Stealify</a>'s implementations of nodejs core methods. as also Supply Bindings for node-v8 and <a href="https://github.com/stealify/stealify">Stealify</a> v8::isolates to get InterOp with the JVM
| Stealify Mobile | 85% | Running Linux, NodeJS, v8, JVM on Android & iOS
| <a href="https://github.com/direktspeed/webstream">WebStream Protocol</a>| 43% | RealTime One To Many Streaming based on torrent & webtrorrent


| Topic | Priority % | Details
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-core">Couchbase Lite</a> | 100 % | A key changing Tech Stack Component. SQLite3 for NOSQL.
| WASM & WASI | 100% | Universal Code Executeable without beeing Rebuild Per Platform aka the next generation Open Modular Software Formart.
| wasmer.io | 100% | a WASM Runtime Written in Rust with a big Success Story and Ecosystem.
| neon-bindings/neon | 100% | Optimize the Tooling to create NodeJS Bindings with rust.
| JVM | | Tuning GC, Compiler Settings and more 
| V8 | | Embedding it into diffrent Software
| Chromium | | Security & Embedding as also using it self as a Platform.
| deno | 100% | a JS Runtime Written in Rust using V8
| WebBiTorrent Protocol | 13% | Bidirectional RealTime Streaming via Many P2P Units in between Maybe Darknet 2.0?
| Deployment | 100% | I am Addicted to Optimization of the general Deployment Processes needed.
| Operation | 100% | I Want to Make it Simple again even on Scale with less Human Intervention.
| Package Creation and Management | 100% | Reducing the Overhead that we have today
| GraalJS Real World usability | 58% | Researching Best Practices to make existing NodeJS Software run Faster on GraalVM |
| v8::isolates Real World usability | 58% | Researching Best Practices to make existing NodeJS Software run Faster on v8::isolates |
| theia/vscode | 100% | Research how to Improve the Deployment and usage inside Cloud Projects, Deployments, As also Modifications like Integrations with Auth Providers and Remote testing. |

<p>A lot of Projects as i join them together into a uniq Project to reduce the redundancies in them as also allow to focus on new features and better performance
together inside the projects. I see redundancy as one of the biggest issues today. As We Produce to much stuff without thinking for example there are over 1000 Package Managers around and maybe even more and they all do the same thing more or less...</p>
<p> The Only good way forward is Functional Composition and drop the use of ".this" in ECMAScript as also create better tooling.</p>
