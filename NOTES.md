## A notes collection
- https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor rust written hyper visor need to look if it uses libKVM rust lib for later integration into couchbase-os and maybe open-pwa and stealify all this stuff.
- looks also like grpc has unwanted overhead i think that is solve able with http/3 but there is also https://github.com/containerd/ttrpc-rust a other protocol that is more light weight.
